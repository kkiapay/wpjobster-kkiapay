Welcome to the Kkiapay WP Jobster plugin repository on GitHub. 

Here you can browse the source code, look at open issues and keep track of development.

## Installation 

### Minimum Requirements

* At least version 4.0.0 of the WPJobster theme

### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WPJobster Kkiapay Gateway, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WPJobster Kkiapay Gateway” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our payment plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our payment plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
